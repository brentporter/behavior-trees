# behavior-trees

This project was forked from and inspired by the article: http://obviam.net/index.php/game-ai-an-introduction-to-behavior-trees

For convenience sake I am repackaging it with a different namespace.

The idea is to use this fork for a discussion of state machines for High School Programmers during Hour of Code

## How to use it

Create a Java project in your favourite IDE and start playing with it.

Have fun :-)
